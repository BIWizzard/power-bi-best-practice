# 07.2 - Top Blogs & Websites

## Overview
Blogs and websites are essential for staying current with Power BI's monthly product updates, learning specific techniques through step-by-step tutorials, and accessing expert insights on real-world problems. While books provide deep foundational knowledge, blogs offer timely, practical guidance on new features, troubleshooting, and evolving best practices. For healthcare analytics teams, following 5-10 high-quality blogs ensures the team stays current without information overload, and provides a go-to resource when encountering specific technical challenges.

## Key Principles

- **Follow Authors, Not Just Websites**: The best Power BI content comes from individual experts (Marco Russo, Reza Rad, Patrick LeBlanc) who consistently publish high-quality, in-depth articles. Follow specific authors within larger platforms.

- **Prioritize Depth Over Volume**: A few comprehensive blogs (SQLBI, PowerBI.Tips, Radacad) are more valuable than 20 generic tutorial sites. Focus on sources that explain *why* something works, not just *how* to click buttons.

- **Subscribe to Microsoft Official Sources**: Power BI updates monthly with new features and deprecations. Following the official Power BI Blog and release notes ensures you're aware of changes that impact your reports and workflows.

- **Use RSS/Email Subscriptions for Curation**: Don't rely on random Google searches or social media algorithms. Subscribe to RSS feeds or email newsletters from trusted sources to receive curated content directly.

- **Bookmark Solutions, Don't Just Read**: When you find a blog post that solves a problem, bookmark it in a team-shared repository (OneNote, SharePoint, browser bookmarks) organized by category (DAX, Performance, Modeling, etc.) for future reference.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Following Too Many Sources (Information Overload)
**Description**: Subscribing to 20+ blogs, newsletters, and YouTube channels, resulting in overwhelming inbox clutter and inability to keep up with all content.

**Impact**: Anxiety about "missing important information," burnout from attempting to read everything, ultimately disengaging from all learning resources. "I have 500 unread blog posts in my inbox, so I just ignore them all now."

**Fix**:
- **Curate to 5-10 essential sources**: Choose quality over quantity
  - Mandatory: Microsoft Power BI Blog, SQLBI, PowerBI.Tips
  - Based on focus: Radacad (comprehensive), Chris Webb (technical depth), Guy in a Cube (video learning)
- **Use aggregators for discovery**: Data Mozart or PowerBI.Tips Weekly Roundup for curated highlights
- **Set realistic reading time**: Allocate 30-60 minutes/week for blog reading, focus on what's relevant to current projects
- **Unsubscribe ruthlessly**: If you haven't read content from a source in 3 months, unsubscribe

### Pitfall 2: Bookmark Hoarding Without Organization
**Description**: Saving dozens of articles with good intentions but no organization system. When you need to find "that article about context transition," you can't locate it in 100+ unsorted bookmarks.

**Impact**: Wasted time re-searching for previously found solutions, duplicating research efforts, frustration when unable to reference valuable articles.

**Fix**:
- **Structured bookmark organization**:
  - `Power BI/DAX/Filter Context`
  - `Power BI/Performance/Model Optimization`
  - `Power BI/Power Query/Query Folding`
  - `Power BI/Governance/RLS`
- **Team-shared repository**: SharePoint OneNote or Teams Wiki with curated article links organized by topic
- **Use browser tools**: Microsoft Edge Collections, Chrome Reading List, or dedicated tools like Pocket/Instapaper
- **Document key takeaways**: When bookmarking, add 1-2 sentence summary of why it's valuable

### Pitfall 3: Relying Only on Blogs Without Practicing
**Description**: Reading tutorials and articles passively without building practice models or applying techniques to real healthcare data.

**Impact**: Knowledge doesn't transfer to practical skills. "I read 50 DAX articles but still struggle to write measures when I need them."

**Fix**:
- **Immediate application**: When reading about a technique, build a practice example within 24 hours
- **Project-based learning**: Before starting a new dashboard, search for relevant articles (e.g., "time intelligence patterns" before building trending dashboard)
- **Team challenges**: Weekly "implement this blog technique" challenges in team meetings
- **Documentation**: Create internal wiki documenting "We tried this technique from [blog], here's how we adapted it for healthcare"

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Publish Dates on Technical Articles
**Description**: Following tutorials from 2017-2018 when Power BI has evolved significantly (features deprecated, new better methods available, UI completely changed).

**Impact**: Learning outdated techniques, frustration when UI doesn't match tutorial, missing newer/better features. "This article says to use this approach but the buttons don't exist anymore."

**Fix**:
- **Check publish date before following tutorial**: Prefer articles from last 12-18 months for UI/feature tutorials
- **Core concepts are timeless**: DAX fundamentals, dimensional modeling, visualization principles from 2017 are still valid
- **Prioritize evergreen content for foundations**: SQLBI's DAX articles from 2018 are still the best resource for filter context
- **Use Microsoft Learn for current UI guidance**: Official docs stay current with monthly updates
- **Check comments**: Often community members note if article is outdated or provide updated approaches

## Healthcare Context

### Healthcare-Specific Power BI Blogs

While most Power BI blogs use retail/sales examples, these sources occasionally feature healthcare-specific content:

#### **Health Catalyst Blog - Analytics**
**URL**: [https://www.healthcatalyst.com/insights/](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/insights/)
**Focus**: Healthcare analytics strategy, population health, clinical quality improvement
**Best For**: Understanding healthcare analytics use cases, translating clinical needs into analytics requirements

#### **HIMSS Analytics**
**URL**: [https://www.himss.org/resources](https://www.himss.org/resources)
**Focus**: Healthcare IT and analytics trends, interoperability, clinical data standards
**Best For**: Healthcare data architecture context, understanding HL7/FHIR standards, clinical data integration

**Note**: Most healthcare analytics professionals follow general Power BI blogs and translate retail examples to healthcare scenarios rather than relying on healthcare-specific Power BI content (which is less common).

### Building Internal Knowledge Base

**Recommendation for AbsoluteCare Team**:

1. **Create SharePoint Site** for team knowledge sharing:
   - "Power BI Resources" document library
   - Organized folders by topic (DAX, Performance, Modeling, etc.)
   - Each folder contains bookmarked articles + team notes

2. **Weekly "Article of the Week"**:
   - One team member shares one valuable article in Friday standup
   - 5-minute discussion: "What did you learn? How could we apply this?"
   - Add to team SharePoint with summary

3. **"Solved Problems" Wiki**:
   - When team solves a complex problem using blog guidance, document:
     - Problem statement
     - Article/blog that helped
     - How we adapted it for healthcare
     - Final solution code
   - Searchable internal knowledge base (reduces duplicate problem-solving)

4. **Quarterly "Blog Review"**:
   - Review which blogs team is actually reading/finding valuable
   - Adjust subscriptions based on team feedback
   - Highlight top 3 articles from quarter (most impactful for healthcare work)

### ROI of Blog Learning

**Time Investment vs. Benefit**:
- **30-60 minutes/week reading curated blogs**: ~40-50 hours/year
- **Typical return**: Saves 2-5 hours/week in problem-solving (don't reinvent solutions)
- **Net annual savings**: 60-200 hours/year (1.5-5 weeks FTE)
- **Quality improvement**: Fewer bugs, better performance, adoption of best practices sooner

**Example Scenario**:
Team encountered slow performance on Patient Census Dashboard. 30-minute search found SQLBI article "Optimizing DAX with Variables" which directly solved the problem (30% performance improvement in 2 hours of implementation). Without blog guidance, team estimated 8-12 hours of trial-and-error troubleshooting.
