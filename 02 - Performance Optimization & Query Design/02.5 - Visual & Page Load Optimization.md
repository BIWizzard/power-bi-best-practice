# 02.5 - Visual & Page Load Optimization

## Overview

Visual rendering and page load performance directly impact user experience and clinical workflow adoption. While data model optimization addresses query speed, visual-level optimization determines how quickly users see results after interacting with reports. In healthcare settings where providers have seconds to check patient census before rounds, every visual counts. Understanding visual performance characteristics, page layout strategies, and interaction optimization enables developers to build reports that load in under 5 seconds and respond instantly to user selectionsthe difference between adoption and abandonment.

## Key Principles

- **Fewer Visuals = Faster Pages**: Each visual executes separate DAX queriespages with 15+ visuals often exceed 5-second SLA, while 6-8 well-designed visuals typically load in 2-3 seconds
- **Visual Type Performance Varies**: Tables and bar charts render fastest (50-200ms), while custom visuals and complex maps can take 2-5 seconds per visualchoose appropriately for use case
- **Interactions Create Query Multiplication**: Cross-filtering between visuals generates additional queriesa page with 10 visuals and full cross-filtering can trigger 50+ queries on single user click
- **Bookmarks vs. Pages Strategy**: Use bookmarks to show/hide visual groups on single page (reduces page navigation overhead) but avoid putting all visuals on one page (everything loads upfront)
- **Measure Performance Over Visual Aesthetics**: A beautiful but slow report gets abandonedPerformance Analyzer should validate every design decision against <5s SLA

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Reducing Visual Count Without Losing Functionality

**Scenario:** Daily huddle patient census report has 18 visuals on single page. Load time: 8.7 seconds. Users complain it's too slow for morning rounds workflow.

**Performance Analyzer results:**

```
Visual Name                          | DAX Query Time | Visual Render | Total Time
-------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|------------
1. KPI: Total Patients               | 145 ms         | 12 ms         | 157 ms
2. KPI: High Risk Patients           | 187 ms         | 15 ms         | 202 ms
3. KPI: Patients Overdue for Visit   | 210 ms         | 18 ms         | 228 ms
4. KPI: Average Risk Score           | 156 ms         | 14 ms         | 170 ms
5. Bar: Patients by Facility         | 342 ms         | 45 ms         | 387 ms
6. Bar: Patients by Provider         | 521 ms         | 52 ms         | 573 ms
7. Bar: Patients by Risk Level       | 289 ms         | 38 ms         | 327 ms
8. Line: Census Trend (30 days)      | 612 ms         | 67 ms         | 679 ms
9. Table: High Risk Patient List     | 1,247 ms       | 125 ms        | 1,372 ms
10. Table: Overdue Visit List        | 1,089 ms       | 98 ms         | 1,187 ms
11. Donut: Patients by Payer Type    | 378 ms         | 48 ms         | 426 ms
12. Map: Patients by ZIP Code        | 2,145 ms       | 487 ms        | 2,632 ms  SLOWEST
13. Slicer: Facility                 | 98 ms          | 22 ms         | 120 ms
14. Slicer: Provider                 | 245 ms         | 28 ms         | 273 ms
15. Slicer: Risk Level               | 67 ms          | 18 ms         | 85 ms
16. Slicer: Date Range               | 45 ms          | 15 ms         | 60 ms
17. Card: Last Refresh Time          | 12 ms          | 8 ms          | 20 ms
18. Text: Report Instructions        | 0 ms           | 5 ms          | 5 ms
-------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|------------
TOTAL PAGE LOAD TIME                                                  | 8,903 ms
```

**Optimization strategy:**

**Step 1: Eliminate redundant KPIs (4 ’ 2)**

```dax
// BEFORE: 4 separate KPI visuals (757 ms combined)
Total Patients (KPI #1)
High Risk Patients (KPI #2)
Patients Overdue for Visit (KPI #3)
Average Risk Score (KPI #4)

// AFTER: 1 multi-row card with 4 measures (180 ms total)
Multi-row card visual with:
  - Total Patients
  - High Risk Patients
  - Overdue Visits
  - Avg Risk Score

SAVINGS: 577 ms (from 757 ms ’ 180 ms)
Visual count: 4 ’ 1
```

**Step 2: Remove slow map visual (2,632 ms)**

```
Map: Patients by ZIP Code (2,632 ms)
  Problem: Renders 287 ZIP codes with custom tooltips
  Usage analysis: Clicked by users in <5% of sessions

Solution: Remove from daily huddle page
  - Move to separate "Geographic Analysis" detail page
  - Keep bar chart "Top 10 ZIP Codes" (fast alternative: 289 ms)

SAVINGS: 2,632 ms
Visual count: 1 ’ 0 (moved to detail page)
```

**Step 3: Combine two detail tables into bookmark toggle**

```
BEFORE: Two always-visible tables (2,559 ms combined)
  Table: High Risk Patient List (1,372 ms)
  Table: Overdue Visit List (1,187 ms)

AFTER: One table with bookmark toggle (1,372 ms when visible)
  Create two bookmarks:
    - "Show High Risk" (displays Table #1, hides Table #2)
    - "Show Overdue" (displays Table #2, hides Table #1)

  Add button bar at top:
    [High Risk Patients] [Overdue Visits]

  Default: Show High Risk list on page load

SAVINGS: 1,187 ms (second table not loaded until clicked)
Visual count: 2 ’ 1 (plus 2 bookmark buttons)
```

**Step 4: Combine three bar charts into single visual with field parameter**

```
BEFORE: 3 separate bar charts (1,287 ms combined)
  Bar: Patients by Facility (387 ms)
  Bar: Patients by Provider (573 ms)
  Bar: Patients by Risk Level (327 ms)

AFTER: 1 bar chart with slicer to switch dimension (450 ms average)
  Create Field Parameter "Group By":
    - Facility
    - Provider
    - Risk Level

  Single bar chart with [Group By] field parameter on axis
  Single-select slicer to toggle between dimensions

SAVINGS: 837 ms (only one chart renders at a time)
Visual count: 3 ’ 1 (plus 1 slicer)
```

**Results after optimization:**

```
Visuals BEFORE: 18 visuals, 8,903 ms (8.9 seconds)
Visuals AFTER:  11 visuals, 2,147 ms (2.1 seconds)

IMPROVEMENT: 76% faster load time
Visual count reduced: 18 ’ 11 (39% reduction)
User experience:  Meets <5s SLA,  Meets <3s target for daily huddle
```

**Why this works:**
- Multi-row cards execute single query for all measures (vs. separate queries per KPI)
- Bookmarks defer loading until user interaction (lazy loading)
- Field parameters allow one visual to serve multiple purposes
- Removing rarely-used visuals (map) eliminates biggest performance bottleneck

### Example 2: Optimizing Cross-Filtering Interactions

**Scenario:** Executive dashboard with 8 visuals. Clicking any slicer causes 3-4 second delay before all visuals update. Users expect instant response.

**Problem: Full cross-filtering enabled by default**

```
Page layout:
  - 4 slicers (Facility, Provider, Date Range, Payer Type)
  - 4 visuals (KPI cards, bar chart, line chart, table)

Cross-filtering behavior (default):
  - All 8 visuals cross-filter all other visuals
  - Clicking Facility slicer triggers 8 DAX queries (one per visual)
  - Each visual also filters other visuals (interaction overhead)
  - Total queries on single click: 8 base + 12 interaction = 20 queries

Performance Analyzer results (clicking Facility slicer):
  Total time to update all visuals: 3,847 ms
```

**Solution: Disable unnecessary interactions**

**Step 1: Disable slicer-to-slicer cross-filtering**

```
Edit Interactions:
  - Select Facility slicer
  - Click "Edit interactions" (Format tab)
  - Disable filtering for other 3 slicers (keep for 4 data visuals)

  Repeat for all slicers:
    - Slicers should NOT cross-filter other slicers
    - Slicers SHOULD filter data visuals only

RESULT: Slicers act independently (reduce query count by 16 on each click)
```

**Step 2: Disable visual-to-KPI cross-filtering**

```
Edit Interactions:
  - Select bar chart (Patients by Facility)
  - Click "Edit interactions"
  - Disable cross-filtering for 4 KPI cards
    (KPIs represent page-level totals, shouldn't change when clicking bar)

  Repeat for line chart and table

RESULT: KPI cards only respond to slicers, not other visuals
  - Clicking bar segment no longer re-queries KPIs
  - KPIs represent consistent "total" context
```

**Step 3: Strategic cross-filtering for related visuals only**

```
Keep cross-filtering enabled ONLY for logical relationships:

   Bar chart (Patients by Facility)
    ’ Filters: Line chart (census trend), Table (patient list)
    ’ Does NOT filter: KPI cards (page-level totals)

   Line chart (Census Trend)
    ’ Filters: Table (patient list for selected date point)
    ’ Does NOT filter: Bar chart, KPI cards

   Table (Patient List)
    ’ Filters: Nothing (detail view, not used for drilling)

Configuration (Edit Interactions):
  Bar chart ’ Line chart: Cross-filter 
  Bar chart ’ Table: Cross-filter 
  Bar chart ’ KPIs: Disabled 

  Line chart ’ Table: Cross-filter 
  Line chart ’ Bar chart: Disabled 
  Line chart ’ KPIs: Disabled 

  Table ’ All: Disabled 
```

**Results after interaction optimization:**

```
BEFORE: Full cross-filtering (default)
  - Clicking Facility slicer: 20 queries, 3,847 ms
  - Clicking bar chart segment: 8 queries, 2,134 ms

AFTER: Strategic interactions only
  - Clicking Facility slicer: 4 queries (slicers ’ data visuals), 847 ms
  - Clicking bar chart segment: 2 queries (bar ’ line, table), 512 ms

IMPROVEMENT:
  - Slicer click: 78% faster (3,847 ms ’ 847 ms)
  - Visual click: 76% faster (2,134 ms ’ 512 ms)
  - User experience: Instant response (<1s)
```

**Best practice interaction configuration:**

```
Interaction Matrix:

                   Filters ’  KPIs  Bar  Line  Table
                                                      
Slicers (Facility/Date)       YES   YES  YES   YES
KPI Cards                      NO   NO   NO    NO
Bar Chart (dimension drill)    NO   NO   YES   YES
Line Chart (time drill)        NO   NO   NO    YES
Table (detail view)            NO   NO   NO    NO
```

### Example 3: Bookmarks vs. Multiple Pages Strategy

**Scenario:** Report requires showing patient data at three different grain levels: Summary, Provider Detail, Patient Detail. Deciding between 3 pages vs. 1 page with bookmarks.

**Option 1: Three separate pages (traditional approach)**

```
Page 1: Summary
  - 6 visuals (KPIs, bar charts, trend line)
  - Load time: 1.2 seconds

Page 2: Provider Detail
  - 9 visuals (provider-level metrics, patient lists, quality measures)
  - Load time: 2.8 seconds

Page 3: Patient Detail
  - 12 visuals (individual patient timeline, encounters, medications, vitals)
  - Load time: 4.1 seconds

User workflow:
  1. Load Summary page: 1.2s
  2. Click to Provider Detail: 2.8s (full page reload)
  3. Click to Patient Detail: 4.1s (full page reload)

  Total time from start to Patient Detail: 8.1s
  Page navigation overhead: 2 full page reloads
```

**Option 2: One page with bookmarks (optimized approach)**

```
Single page with all visuals, controlled by bookmarks:

Bookmark 1: "Summary View"
  - Shows: 6 summary visuals
  - Hides: 15 detail visuals (provider + patient)
  - Load time on page open: 1.2s (only visible visuals render)

Bookmark 2: "Provider Detail View"
  - Shows: 6 summary visuals + 9 provider visuals (15 total)
  - Hides: 12 patient detail visuals
  - Transition time: 1.6s (incremental load of 9 new visuals)

Bookmark 3: "Patient Detail View"
  - Shows: All 27 visuals
  - Hides: Nothing
  - Transition time: 2.3s (incremental load of 12 new visuals)

User workflow:
  1. Load page (Summary bookmark default): 1.2s
  2. Click "Provider Detail" bookmark: 1.6s (show additional visuals)
  3. Click "Patient Detail" bookmark: 2.3s (show remaining visuals)

  Total time from start to Patient Detail: 5.1s
  IMPROVEMENT: 37% faster than 3-page approach (5.1s vs 8.1s)

Benefits:
  - Slicers persist across views (no re-selection needed)
  - Context maintained (user doesn't lose filter state)
  - Faster transitions (incremental visual load vs. full page reload)
  - Single page easier to maintain (update once vs. update 3 pages)
```

**Implementation: Bookmarks with button navigation**

```
Step 1: Create three bookmarks
  - Summary (default): Visuals 1-6 visible, 7-27 hidden
  - Provider Detail: Visuals 1-15 visible, 16-27 hidden
  - Patient Detail: All visuals 1-27 visible

Step 2: Add button navigation bar at top of page

                                                           
   [Summary] [Provider Detail] [Patient Detail]            
   (buttons with bookmark actions)                         
                                                           

  Configure each button:
    - Action: Bookmark
    - Bookmark: [respective view]
    - Button state: Selected = TRUE when bookmark active

Step 3: Organize visuals in logical groupings

  Layout strategy:
    - Row 1: Slicers (always visible across all bookmarks)
    - Row 2: Summary KPIs (visible in all bookmarks)
    - Row 3-4: Summary charts (visible in all bookmarks)
    - Row 5-7: Provider detail visuals (hidden in Summary)
    - Row 8-12: Patient detail visuals (hidden in Summary & Provider)
```

**When to use bookmarks vs. separate pages:**

```
Use BOOKMARKS when:
 Views share same slicers/filters (avoid re-selecting)
 Progressive drill-down (summary ’ detail progression)
 Fast context switching needed (instant toggle)
 Total visuals across all views <30
 Mobile users (fewer page navigation taps)

Use SEPARATE PAGES when:
 Completely different contexts (different dimensions/measures)
 Different audiences (exec summary vs. analyst detail)
 Total visuals >30 (single page becomes unwieldy)
 Print requirements (each page prints separately)
 Different data sources or RLS (isolation needed)
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Too Many Visuals on a Single Page

Adding 15-25 visuals to single page because "users want to see everything at once," exceeding <5 second load time SLA and overwhelming users with information density.

**Impact**: Page load times exceed 8-12 seconds (users abandon), visual clutter reduces usability (paradox: more visuals = less insight), mobile rendering fails (page too tall/wide), refresh operations slow (all visuals re-query), Performance Analyzer shows "long visual load" warnings across board.

**Example mistake:**

```
Patient Census Dashboard - Single Page:
  - 8 KPI cards
  - 6 bar/column charts
  - 3 line charts (trends)
  - 2 tables (patient lists)
  - 1 map (geographic distribution)
  - 6 slicers
                   
  Total: 26 visuals

Performance Analyzer results:
  - Page load time: 11.4 seconds
  - Slowest visual: Map (3.2s)
  - Combined DAX query time: 8.7s
  - Visual rendering: 2.7s
  - Users abandoning page before full load
```

**Fix: Apply "6-8 visual" rule with bookmark drill-down**

```
Redesign into progressive disclosure:

Page Load (Default - Summary bookmark):
  - 4 KPI cards (key metrics only)
  - 2 bar charts (most important dimensions)
  - 1 line chart (primary trend)
  - 5 slicers
                   
  Total: 12 visuals visible
  Load time: 2.1 seconds 

Bookmark: "Show Detail Metrics"
  - Adds 3 more bar charts
  - Adds 1 table (top 10 list)
  - Total visible: 16 visuals
  - Transition time: 1.4s

Bookmark: "Show Patient List"
  - Adds detailed patient table
  - Total visible: 17 visuals
  - Transition time: 2.8s (table is slow, acceptable for detail view)

Result:
  - Initial load: 2.1s (meets <5s SLA)
  - Progressive drill-down available for power users
  - Most users (80%) stay on summary view (fast)
  - Detail users (20%) accept 2-3s transition for comprehensive view
```

**Visual count targets by page type:**

```
Daily operational dashboards:     6-8 visuals (target <2s load)
Executive summaries:              8-12 visuals (target <3s load)
Analytical detail pages:          12-18 visuals (target <5s load)
Drill-through detail pages:       15-25 visuals (acceptable 5-8s, rarely accessed)

Rule of thumb:
  - If page exceeds 5s load, either:
    A) Remove visuals (consolidate, eliminate redundant)
    B) Split into bookmarks (progressive disclosure)
    C) Create separate drill-through page (for detail)
```

### Pitfall 2: Using Slow Custom Visuals for Simple Tasks

Choosing custom visuals from AppSource for aesthetic appeal without testing performance, when native visuals would accomplish the same goal 5-10x faster.

**Impact**: Single custom visual takes 2-4 seconds to render (native equivalent: 200-400ms), custom visuals increase .pbix file size, some custom visuals don't support mobile, security/compliance concerns (third-party code execution), maintenance risk (visual publisher may stop supporting).

**Example mistake:**

```
Executive KPI Dashboard uses custom "Speedometer" visual from AppSource:

Performance Analyzer:
  Visual: Speedometer - Patient Satisfaction Score
    DAX Query Time: 145 ms
    Visual Display Time: 3,247 ms  VERY SLOW
    Total: 3,392 ms

  (Native KPI card with same data: 145 ms query + 18 ms render = 163 ms)

  Custom visual is 21x slower than native KPI card
```

**Fix: Use native visuals for core metrics**

```
BEFORE: Custom speedometer visual (3,392 ms)
                 
   m   n         
  q     r  87%      Animated gauge, gradients, custom tooltips
    Ï               Looks impressive, loads slowly
  r     q        
   p   o         
                 

AFTER: Native KPI card (163 ms)
                 
 Patient Satisfaction 
      87%               Clean, fast, mobile-friendly
   ² 3% vs LM            Power BI native styling
                 

IMPROVEMENT: 95% faster (3,392 ms ’ 163 ms)
Visual count: Same (1 visual)
Functionality: Same (displays value and trend)
Aesthetics: Cleaner, more professional
```

**When custom visuals are justified:**

```
 APPROPRIATE use cases:
  - Gantt charts (project timelines) - no native equivalent
  - Network diagrams (relationships) - no native equivalent
  - Sankey diagrams (flow visualization) - no native equivalent
  - Specialized industry visuals (e.g., healthcare-specific clinical pathways)

 INAPPROPRIATE use cases:
  - Fancy gauges (use native KPI card)
  - 3D charts (use native 2D charts - better for data viz anyway)
  - Animated counters (use native card)
  - Custom calendars (use native matrix or table)
  - Decorative charts (prioritize performance over aesthetics)
```

**Decision framework:**

```
Before adding custom visual from AppSource, ask:

1. Performance test:
   - Does it render in <500ms with production data volumes?
   - If NO ’ Look for native alternative

2. Necessity test:
   - Does a native visual accomplish 90% of the goal?
   - If YES ’ Use native visual

3. Mobile test:
   - Does it work on Power BI Mobile app?
   - If NO ’ Will mobile users need this visual?

4. Maintenance test:
   - Is visual publisher reputable (Microsoft, major vendor)?
   - Last updated within 6 months?
   - If NO ’ Risk of abandonment

5. Security test:
   - Does your organization allow third-party visuals?
   - HIPAA compliance if healthcare data displayed?
   - If NO ’ Cannot use custom visual
```

### Pitfall 3: Not Using Persistent Filters for Report-Wide Context

Requiring users to select same filters on every page (facility, date range), causing frustration and wasted time re-selecting context after each page navigation.

**Impact**: Users re-select facility on every page (5-7 clicks per session), inconsistent filtering across pages (users forget to set filter on one page), increased support calls ("Why are the numbers different on Page 2?"), poor user experience (feels inefficient, users complain), slower page loads (each page re-queries with different filters).

**Example mistake:**

```
Multi-page report: Patient Census (3 pages)

Page 1: Summary
  - Slicers: Facility, Date Range, Payer Type
  - User selects: Facility = "Main Campus", Date Range = "Last 30 Days"

Page 2: Provider Detail
  - Slicers: Facility, Date Range, Provider
  - User navigates to Page 2
  - PROBLEM: Facility and Date Range slicers RESET (back to "All")
  - User must re-select: Facility = "Main Campus", Date Range = "Last 30 Days"
  - Then select Provider

Page 3: Patient List
  - Slicers: Facility, Date Range, Risk Level
  - User navigates to Page 3
  - PROBLEM: Facility and Date Range slicers RESET AGAIN
  - User must re-select for third time

User workflow:
  - 3 pages visited
  - 6 total slicer selections needed (2 per page × 3 pages)
  - Frustration: "Why can't it remember my selections?"
```

**Fix: Sync slicers across all pages**

```
Step 1: Identify report-wide filters
  Common across all pages:
    - Facility (dimensions users set once, use everywhere)
    - Date Range (time context consistent across pages)

  Page-specific filters:
    - Provider (only relevant on Provider Detail page)
    - Risk Level (only relevant on Patient List page)

Step 2: Configure sync slicers

  For Facility slicer:
    1. Select Facility slicer on Page 1
    2. View ’ Sync Slicers panel
    3. Check "Sync" for all pages (Page 1, 2, 3)
    4. Check "Visible" for all pages
    5. Result: Facility selection persists across page navigation

  For Date Range slicer:
    1. Select Date Range slicer on Page 1
    2. View ’ Sync Slicers panel
    3. Check "Sync" for all pages
    4. Check "Visible" for all pages
    5. Result: Date Range selection persists across page navigation

Step 3: Test sync slicer behavior

  User workflow (after sync slicers configured):
    - Page 1: Select Facility = "Main Campus", Date Range = "Last 30 Days"
    - Navigate to Page 2: Facility and Date Range AUTOMATICALLY SET 
    - User only selects Provider (page-specific)
    - Navigate to Page 3: Facility and Date Range STILL SET 
    - User only selects Risk Level (page-specific)

  Total slicer selections: 4 (vs. 6 before)
  User experience: "It remembers my context!" 
```

**Sync slicer best practices:**

```
ALWAYS sync these slicers across all pages:
 Date/Date Range (time context)
 Facility/Location (organizational unit)
 Department (organizational hierarchy)
 Payer Type (common healthcare dimension)

SOMETIMES sync (depends on report design):
? Provider (if relevant across multiple pages)
? Patient (if multi-page patient drill-down)

NEVER sync (page-specific context):
 Metric selector (different metrics per page)
 Visual-specific filters (e.g., "Top N" selector for one chart)
 Drill-through specific filters
```

**Alternative: Report-level filters (Filters pane)**

```
For filters that should ALWAYS apply (never changed by users):

Option 1: Sync slicers (user-visible, changeable)
  - Users see slicers, can change selections
  - Selections persist across pages
  - Use when users need to change filter regularly

Option 2: Report-level filters (Filters pane, less visible)
  - Filters pane ’ Report level
  - Add Facility, Date Range filters
  - Users can change, but less prominent
  - Use when filter rarely changes (e.g., always "Current Month")

Option 3: Hidden filters (applied in DAX measures)
  - No slicer visible at all
  - Filter logic in measure definition
  - Use when filter NEVER changes (e.g., "Active Patients Only")

Example - hidden filter in measure:
Total Active Patients =
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(DimPatient),
    DimPatient[IsActive] = TRUE  -- Hidden filter, always applied
)
```

## Healthcare Context

### Clinical Workflow Performance Requirements

Healthcare provider workflows have strict time constraints:

| Workflow | Performance SLA | Visual Count Target | Example Use Case |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Pre-rounds huddle | <2 seconds | 6-8 visuals | Nurse checks patient census before morning rounds |
| Provider check-in | <3 seconds | 8-10 visuals | Doctor reviews patient panel at start of day |
| Care management review | <5 seconds | 12-15 visuals | Care manager analyzes high-risk patient cohort |
| Executive dashboard | <5 seconds | 10-12 visuals | VP reviews organizational KPIs |
| Ad-hoc analysis | <8 seconds | 15-20 visuals | Analyst explores data trends |

**Page load time directly impacts clinical workflow:**
- <2s: Seamless integration into workflow (ideal)
- 2-5s: Acceptable, minor delay but usable
- 5-8s: Frustrating, providers complain but use reluctantly
- >8s: Abandoned, providers revert to manual processes or Excel

**AbsoluteCare example:**
- Daily huddle report optimized from 8.7s ’ 2.1s
- Provider adoption increased from 45% ’ 87%
- Excel manual census report discontinued (providers preferred Power BI)

### Mobile Field Access

Home health nurses and field care managers access reports on tablets/phones:

**Mobile performance challenges:**
- Cellular data (slower than office Wi-Fi)
- Smaller screen (fewer visuals fit on single page)
- Touch interface (slicers and buttons easier than hover interactions)
- Limited processing power (custom visuals render even slower)

**Mobile optimization strategy:**

```
Mobile Layout (Power BI Mobile app):
  - Design separate mobile layout: View ’ Mobile Layout
  - Prioritize 4-6 most important visuals only
  - Use large touch targets (buttons, slicers)
  - Disable hover tooltips (use drill-through instead)
  - Test on actual devices (not just emulator)

Visual count for mobile:
  - Summary page: 4-6 visuals maximum
  - Detail page: 6-8 visuals maximum
  - Avoid custom visuals entirely (performance, compatibility)
```

### Print-Optimized Performance

Daily huddle reports often printed for morning rounds:

**Print performance considerations:**
- Print-friendly layouts typically have fewer visuals (8-10 max per page)
- Static content loads faster than interactive (no cross-filtering overhead)
- Tables and simple charts print better than complex visuals
- Page size constraints (Letter/A4) naturally limit visual count
