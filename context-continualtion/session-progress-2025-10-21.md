## Session 3 Progress (October 21, 2025)

**Session 3 Start**: ~[Current time]
**Starting Point**: 19 topics complete (51%), beginning remaining Tier 4 topics

### Tier 4 Topics Completed This Session:

#### 20. `02.2 - Data Model Size Reduction.md` ✅
- **Status**: Complete (~5 pages)
- **Category**: Performance Optimization & Query Design
- **Key Topics Covered**:
  - VertiPaq columnar compression mechanics (high vs. low cardinality impact)
  - Removing high-cardinality columns (GUID, free-text notes, audit timestamps)
  - Data type optimization (Int64→Int32, DateTime→Date, Text→Boolean)
  - Aggregation tables for large fact tables (monthly grain, 99.95% row reduction)
  - Column elimination strategy (explicit selection vs. importing everything)
  - Model size monitoring workflow (DAX Studio VertiPaq Analyzer)
- **Healthcare Context**: Large encounter/claims tables (2.5M-7.5M rows), model size vs. mobile sync time, HIPAA PHI considerations, 3-year vs. 7-year data retention, target <300 MB for mobile field access
- **Common Pitfalls**: Importing every column "just in case" (40-60% waste), using text data types for everything (3-10x size impact), not monitoring model size after changes (gradual degradation)
- **Assessment Integration**: Addresses bloated models with unused columns, optimization opportunities in AbsoluteCare reports
- **File Path**: `/Users/kmgdev/dev_projects/power-bi-best-practice/02 - Performance Optimization & Query Design/02.2 - Data Model Size Reduction.md`

  - Multi-row cards vs. multiple KPI visuals (query consolidation)
  - Field parameters for dimension toggling (reduce visual count)
  - Sync slicers for persistent filters across pages
- **Healthcare Context**: Clinical workflow SLA (<2s huddle, <3s check-in, <5s dashboard), mobile field access performance, print-optimized visual count, provider adoption correlation with load time
- **Common Pitfalls**: Too many visuals on single page (15-25 visuals, >8s load), slow custom visuals for simple tasks (21x slower than native), not using persistent filters (users re-select every page)
- **Assessment Integration**: Daily huddle optimization (8.7s → 2.1s, 45% → 87% adoption), addresses slow report complaints

  - Complex conditional logic with variables (readmission rate example)
  - Time intelligence with variables (YoY growth calculations)
  - Debugging intermediate values with DAX Studio
  - Measure chaining pattern (base measures + derived measures)

  - CALCULATE modifies filter context (ALL, ALLSELECTED, ALLEXCEPT patterns)
  - Context transition (row context → filter context with CALCULATE)
  - Filter context in visuals (matrix example with facility/provider hierarchy)
  - ALL vs. ALLSELECTED decision framework (respecting slicers)
  - RELATED vs. CALCULATE in different contexts
  - Context visualization diagrams
- **Healthcare Context**: Patient attribution calculations (PCP panels), quality measure denominators (HEDIS/CMS), encounter-level vs. patient-level metrics (preventing double-counting), provider role filtering

  - Month-over-month (MoM) and quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) with DATEADD
  - DATEADD vs. PARALLELPERIOD comparison
  - Date table creation (CALENDAR, CALENDARAUTO, SQL view)
- **Healthcare Context**: Clinical quality metrics trending (HEDIS, CMS Stars 3-year trends), fiscal year reporting (Oct 1 - Sep 30), patient readmission 30-day windows, census moving averages for staffing decisions
- **Common Pitfalls**: Missing or improperly configured date table (time intelligence fails), using non-date columns (gaps cause errors), not handling BLANK values (division errors in first year)
- **Assessment Integration**: AbsoluteCare missing date table (identified gap), SQL view implementation for ABCDW.StarSchema.DimDate
- **File Path**: `/Users/kmgdev/dev_projects/power-bi-best-practice/03 - DAX Development Best Practices/03.4 - Time Intelligence Patterns.md`
