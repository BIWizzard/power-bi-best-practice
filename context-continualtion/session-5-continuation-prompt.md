SPECIAL NOTES FOR CATEGORY 07 TOPICS:
**Continuous Learning & Community Resources** topics (07.1-07.5) use adapted template:

**No code examples needed** - These are curated resource lists, not technical how-to guides

**Organize by subcategory**:
- Books: By topic area (DAX, data modeling, visualization, general BI)
- Blogs: By author/organization
- LinkedIn: By expertise area (DAX, data viz, governance, healthcare BI)
- Forums: By platform (official, Reddit, LinkedIn groups, specialized)
- Certifications: By career path (analyst, architect, admin)

**Include descriptions** - Explain why each resource is valuable, what it's best for

**Healthcare angle** - Highlight healthcare-specific resources where available

**Practical guidance** - How to use these resources (study plans, learning paths, time commitment)

**Template adaptation for Category 07**:
- Overview: Why this category of resources matters for Power BI mastery
- Key Principles: How to evaluate/choose resources in this category
- Practical Examples → Featured Resources: Top 10-15 curated recommendations
- Common Pitfalls: Mistakes in learning approach (jumping to advanced topics, not practicing, tutorial hell)
- Healthcare Context: Healthcare-specific resources, career development for healthcare BI analysts
- Learn More: Meta-resources (resource directories, aggregators, how to stay current)

## Session Management Protocol

1. **Start Session**: Read both context documents (main context + session progress)
2. **Begin Final Topics**: Write remaining 6 topics in order (start with 06.5)
3. **After Each Topic**:
   - Update session-progress-2025-10-21.md with topic summary
   - Ask user to check `/context`
   - User decides: continue or new session
4. **Quality Check**: Every topic matches Sessions 1-4 quality/detail
5. **Context Monitoring**: Stop at 75-80% context usage if needed for clean handoff
6. **Goal**: Complete all 6 remaining topics to reach 37/37 (100% COMPLETE!)

## Files Modified Per Topic

Per topic completion:
1. New topic file: `[Category]/[Number] - [Name].md`
2. Updated: `context-continualtion/session-progress-2025-10-21.md`

DO NOT modify:
- Main context document (ideation-setup-context.md) - historical record
- Template file (already created)
- Session 1-4 continuation prompts - historical records
- README files - update only after ALL 37 topics complete

   - Total page count estimate (topics average 6 pages × 37 = ~220 pages)
   - All 7 categories complete
   - Ready for PDF generation using Pandoc
   - Ready for client review and delivery

**Next Steps After Completion**:
1. **PDF Generation**: Use Pandoc command from BUILD-README.md to generate final PDF
2. **Final Review**: Proofread, check cross-links, verify formatting
