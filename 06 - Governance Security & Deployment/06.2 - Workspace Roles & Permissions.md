# 06.2 - Workspace Roles & Permissions

## Overview
Power BI workspace security controls who can view, edit, and manage reports, datasets, and dashboards. Unlike row-level security (RLS) which filters data within reports, workspace roles determine access to the workspace itself and what actions users can perform on workspace content. The four workspace rolesAdmin, Member, Contributor, and Viewerprovide progressively restricted permissions, enabling the principle of least privilege access. In healthcare environments handling PHI, proper workspace role assignment is essential for HIPAA compliance, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access clinical dashboards, and that separation of duties prevents unauthorized data modifications. Understanding workspace roles, app permissions, external user access, and the interaction between workspace roles and RLS is critical for secure, compliant Power BI governance.

## Key Principles

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign the minimum workspace role necessary for users to perform their job functions. Default to Viewer role for report consumers who only need to view dashboards, reserve Member/Admin roles for developers and IT administrators who need to modify content. Don't give everyone Admin access "just in case."
- **Workspace Roles vs. App Permissions**: Workspace roles grant direct workspace access (power users, developers, admins). App permissions grant read-only access to published apps (end users, executives, clinicians). Most clinical staff should access reports via apps, not direct workspace access, reducing PHI exposure and simplifying permission management.
- **Separation of Duties**: Production workspaces should have different admins than Dev/Test workspaces to prevent developers from accidentally modifying production content. Financial/clinical reporting may require separate workspace admins to enforce business unit separation and audit independence.
- **External User Access Control**: External users (contractors, consultants, partners outside your Microsoft Entra tenant) can be granted workspace access but require additional scrutiny for HIPAA compliance. External users should never have Admin/Member roles in PHI-containing workspaces unless covered by Business Associate Agreement (BAA).
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Conduct quarterly access reviews to identify stale user accounts (ex-employees still with workspace access), over-permissioned users (Viewers who should have app access instead), and external users no longer requiring access. Revoke access proactively to maintain least privilege.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Workspace Role Assignment for Clinical Reporting Team

**Scenario**: AbsoluteCare Clinical Reporting workspace contains daily huddle dashboard, quality metrics, and patient census reports. Need to assign appropriate roles to 5 developers, 15 clinical staff, 3 executives, and 1 external consultant.

**Workspace Role Assignments**:

**Admin Role** (2 users - IT leadership only):
- **IT Director** (john.smith@absolutecare.com): Manages workspace settings, assigns roles, can delete workspace
- **BI Manager** (sarah.johnson@absolutecare.com): Oversees development team, manages deployment pipeline

**Why Admin**: Full control over workspace needed for organizational governance, role assignment, and emergency access revocation.

**Member Role** (5 users - Power BI development team):
- **Developer 1** (maria.garcia@absolutecare.com): Develops daily huddle dashboard
- **Developer 2** (tom.chen@absolutecare.com): Develops quality metrics reports
- **Developer 3** (lisa.park@absolutecare.com): Develops financial reports
- **Developer 4** (james.wilson@absolutecare.com): Develops patient census reports
- **Developer 5** (emily.brown@absolutecare.com): Develops provider productivity reports

**Why Member**: Can publish reports, edit datasets, create content. Cannot manage workspace settings or assign roles (prevents developers from self-promoting to Admin). Cannot delete workspace (protection against accidental deletion).

**Contributor Role** (1 user - external consultant):
- **External Consultant** (consultant@externalfirm.com): Creates ad-hoc reports for executive team project

**Why Contributor**: Can publish reports but cannot edit shared datasets (prevents accidental dataset corruption affecting production reports). Appropriate for external contractors who need limited content creation without full dataset access.

**Viewer Role** (0 users - not recommended for end users):
- *(None - end users should access via app instead)*

**Why No Viewers**: Viewer role provides direct workspace access showing all workspace content (Dev reports, Test reports, drafts). End users should access via published app which shows only curated production-ready reports.

**App Permissions** (18 users - clinical staff and executives):
- **Clinical Staff** (15 users): Dr. Anderson, Nurse Johnson, Care Coordinator Lee, etc.
- **Executives** (3 users): CEO, CFO, CMO

**App Access Configuration**:
- Publish "Clinical Reporting" app from workspace
- Grant app access to security group: "ClinicalStaff-ReportViewers" (15 members)
- Grant app access to security group: "Executives-ReportViewers" (3 members)
- App shows only production reports (Daily Huddle, Quality Metrics, Patient Census)
- RLS filters data per user's attributed patients/providers

**Why App Access**: Simplifies permission management (assign groups, not individuals), hides workspace complexity, shows only production-ready content, no accidental exposure to Dev/Test reports.

**Permission Summary Table**:
| User Type | Count | Access Method | Role | Can View | Can Edit | Can Publish |
|-----------|-------|---------------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| IT Leadership | 2 | Direct Workspace | Admin |  |  |  |
| Developers | 5 | Direct Workspace | Member |  |  |  |
| External Consultant | 1 | Direct Workspace | Contributor |  |  |  (reports only) |
| Clinical Staff | 15 | App | App User |  |  |  |
| Executives | 3 | App | App User |  |  |  |

### Example 2: Workspace Role Permissions Matrix

**Scenario**: Understanding what each workspace role can and cannot do to assign roles appropriately.

**Workspace Role Permissions**:

| Capability | Admin | Member | Contributor | Viewer |
|------------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Content Viewing** |
| View reports in workspace |  |  |  |  |
| View dashboards |  |  |  |  |
| View datasets (metadata) |  |  |  |  |
| Export data from visuals |  |  |  |  |
| **Content Creation** |
| Create new reports |  |  |  |  |
| Edit existing reports |  |  |  |  |
| Create new datasets |  |  |  |  |
| Edit existing datasets |  |  |  |  |
| Create dashboards |  |  |  |  |
| Pin visuals to dashboards |  |  |  |  |
| **Publishing & Sharing** |
| Publish reports to workspace |  |  |  |  |
| Publish & manage app |  |  |  |  |
| Share reports outside workspace |  |  |  (own only) |  |
| Allow others to reshare |  |  |  |  |
| **Data Management** |
| Schedule dataset refresh |  |  |  |  |
| Configure refresh credentials |  |  |  |  |
| Configure incremental refresh |  |  |  |  |
| Update parameters |  |  |  |  |
| **Workspace Management** |
| Add/remove users |  |  |  |  |
| Change user roles |  |  |  |  |
| Edit workspace settings |  |  |  |  |
| Delete workspace |  |  |  |  |
| Configure deployment pipeline |  |  |  |  |
| **Advanced Features** |
| Configure workspace OneLake |  |  |  |  |
| Manage workspace storage |  |  |  |  |
| Configure Git integration |  |  |  |  |

**Key Differences to Note**:
- **Contributor vs. Member**: Contributor can publish new reports but cannot edit shared datasets (prevents dataset corruption). Use for external consultants or junior analysts who should create isolated content.
- **Viewer vs. App User**: Viewer has direct workspace access (sees all content including drafts). App User only sees published app content (production-ready reports). Prefer app access for end users.
- **Admin vs. Member**: Only Admins can manage workspace membership and settings. Members cannot self-promote or add users, maintaining governance control.

### Example 3: External User Access with BAA Compliance

**Scenario**: External consulting firm (Trace3) providing Power BI development support needs workspace access to Production workspace containing PHI. Must comply with HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) requirements.

**BAA Compliance Requirements**:
1. **Executed BAA**: Signed Business Associate Agreement between AbsoluteCare (Covered Entity) and Trace3 (Business Associate)
2. **Access Justification**: Document business need for PHI access (Power BI development, optimization, training)
3. **Minimum Necessary**: Grant minimum workspace role and duration necessary
4. **Access Logging**: Monitor and audit external user activity via Power BI activity logs
5. **Access Termination**: Revoke access immediately upon project completion

**Implementation**:

**Step 1: Verify BAA Execution**
- Confirm signed BAA exists between AbsoluteCare and Trace3
- BAA includes Power BI / Azure cloud services as covered systems
- BAA includes data breach notification requirements (72-hour reporting)

**Step 2: Add External User to Workspace**
- Navigate to workspace ’ Settings ’ Access
- Add external user: ken.gallagher@trace3.com
- Assign role: **Contributor** (not Admin or Member - minimize privileges)
- Document justification: "Power BI optimization project, 6-week engagement, ends 2025-12-01"

**Step 3: Configure Access Controls**
- **RLS Applied**: External user subject to same RLS as internal users (if no provider attribution, sees no patient data)
- **MFA Required**: External user must have multi-factor authentication enabled on their Microsoft account
- **Conditional Access**: Require compliant device (managed by Trace3 IT) for Power BI access
- **Session Timeout**: External user session expires after 8 hours of inactivity

**Step 4: Access Monitoring**
- Enable Power BI activity logging (already enabled for HIPAA compliance)
- Monitor external user activity weekly: Reports accessed, data exported, datasets modified
- Alert on suspicious activity: Access outside business hours (9 AM - 5 PM EST), bulk data export (>10,000 rows)

**Step 5: Access Termination** (upon project completion - December 1, 2025)
- Remove ken.gallagher@trace3.com from workspace access
- Verify removal in Power BI activity logs (should show "Access Revoked" event)
- Document termination date for compliance audit trail
- Retain access logs for 7 years per HIPAA requirements

**External User Access Checklist**:
```
External User Access - HIPAA Compliance Checklist

User: ken.gallagher@trace3.com
Company: Trace3 (Business Associate)
Access Period: 2025-10-21 to 2025-12-01 (6 weeks)

¡ BAA executed and on file (Legal Department confirmation)
¡ Business justification documented (Power BI optimization project)
¡ Workspace role assigned: Contributor (minimum necessary)
¡ RLS configuration verified (external user sees only authorized data)
¡ MFA enabled on external user account (verified)
¡ Conditional access policy applied (compliant device required)
¡ Access monitoring configured (weekly activity review)
¡ Access termination date scheduled (2025-12-01)
¡ Audit trail documentation complete (access request, approval, termination)

Approved by: Sarah Johnson (BI Manager)
Date: 2025-10-21
```

**Why this works**: External user access meets HIPAA BAA requirements through documented business need, minimum necessary access (Contributor, not Admin), access monitoring, and scheduled termination. Audit trail supports compliance reviews.

## Common Pitfalls

### L Pitfall 1: Granting Admin Role to Too Many Users
**Description**: Assigning Admin role to all developers, multiple analysts, or anyone who "might need to add users someday," creating a large pool of users with full workspace control.

**Impact**: Over-privileged users can accidentally delete workspace, remove other admins, modify deployment pipeline settings, or assign themselves elevated permissions in other workspaces. In HIPAA environments, excessive Admin roles violate minimum necessary principle and create audit findings. Example: Developer accidentally deletes Production workspace on Friday afternoon before long weekendworkspace recovery requires Microsoft support ticket and 24-72 hour SLA.

**Prevention**:
- **Limit Admins**: Maximum 2-3 Admin users per workspace (IT leadership, BI manager, backup admin for vacations/emergencies)
- **Use Member Instead**: Developers need Member role (can publish, edit content) but not Admin (cannot manage users or delete workspace)
- **Document Admin Rationale**: Justify each Admin assignment in access review documentation
- **Conditional Admin**: For temporary admin needs (consultant configuring deployment pipeline), grant Admin role temporarily, revoke after task complete

**Recommended Admin Assignments**:
| Workspace Type | Admin Users | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Production | IT Director, BI Manager | Governance control, emergency access |
| Test | BI Manager, Lead Developer | UAT coordination, test environment control |
| Dev | Lead Developer, Senior Developer | Development environment flexibility |

### L Pitfall 2: Using Workspace Viewer Role for End Users Instead of App Access
**Description**: Granting Viewer role to clinical staff, executives, or other report consumers, providing direct workspace access instead of publishing an app and granting app permissions.

**Impact**: Viewer role users see ALL workspace content including development drafts, test reports, broken reports, and internal documentation. Creates confusion ("Which report should I use?"), support burden ("Why are there 5 census reports?"), and PHI exposure risk (viewing test data that should be restricted). Viewer management is per-workspace, per-userdoesn't scale beyond 10-20 users without significant admin overhead.

**Prevention**:
- **Use Apps for End Users**: Publish production-ready reports as app, grant app access to security groups
- **Reserve Viewer for Power Users**: Only assign Viewer role to analysts who need to browse all workspace content for self-service analytics or dashboard creation
- **App Benefits**: Curated content (only production reports), group-based permissions (manage groups, not individuals), simplified navigation (app homepage, custom sections)

**App vs. Viewer Comparison**:
| Capability | Viewer Role | App Access |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| See draft/test reports |  (sees everything) |  (only published app content) |
| Permission management | Per-user, per-workspace | Per-group (scalable) |
| Navigation complexity | All workspace content | Curated app navigation |
| Self-service analytics | Can create reports from workspace datasets | Can create reports from app datasets (if enabled) |
| Recommended for | Analysts, power users (5-10 users) | Clinical staff, executives (50-500+ users) |

### L Pitfall 3: Not Reviewing Workspace Access Regularly (Stale Accounts)
**Description**: Setting workspace role assignments once at project launch and never reviewing or updating, allowing ex-employees, ex-contractors, or transferred staff to retain workspace access indefinitely.

**Impact**: Former employees with workspace access create security risk (unauthorized PHI access, data exfiltration). Transferred employees with outdated permissions violate least privilege (clinical staff who moved to non-clinical role still accessing patient data). HIPAA compliance audits flag stale accounts as access control failures.

**Prevention**:
- **Quarterly Access Reviews**: Every 90 days, review workspace membership, identify inactive accounts, revoke unnecessary access
- **Automated Alerts**: Use Power BI activity logs to identify accounts with no activity in 60 days (likely stale)
- **Termination Workflow Integration**: When employee leaves organization, IT offboarding checklist includes "Remove from all Power BI workspaces"
- **Access Justification**: Document business need for each user's workspace access during reviews

**Access Review Process**:
```
Quarterly Workspace Access Review - Clinical Reporting Workspace
Review Date: 2025-10-21
Reviewer: Sarah Johnson (BI Manager)

Review Steps:
1. Export workspace member list (Workspace ’ Access ’ Export to Excel)
2. Cross-reference with HR active employee list
3. Identify inactive accounts (no Power BI activity in 60+ days via activity logs)
4. Review external user access (verify BAA status, project still active)
5. Verify role assignments match job functions (Viewer ’ App migration candidates)

Findings:
- 2 stale accounts found: john.doe@absolutecare.com (terminated 2025-08-15), jane.smith@absolutecare.com (transferred to HR, no longer needs clinical data access)
- 1 external consultant: Access expires 2025-12-01 (verified, no action needed)
- 3 Viewer role users: Recommend migration to App access (simplify permissions)

Actions Taken:
- Removed john.doe@absolutecare.com and jane.smith@absolutecare.com from workspace
- Notified 3 Viewer users of migration to App access (scheduled 2025-11-01)
- Documented review in compliance folder for audit trail

Next Review: 2026-01-21 (90 days)
```

### L Pitfall 4: Granting External Users Admin/Member Roles Without BAA
**Description**: Adding external consultants, contractors, or partners to workspace with Admin or Member roles without verifying Business Associate Agreement (BAA) execution, especially in workspaces containing PHI.

**Impact**: HIPAA violation if external user accesses PHI without BAA. Regulatory fines ($100-$50,000 per violation, up to $1.5M annual cap per violation category). Compliance audit findings requiring remediation and enhanced monitoring. Potential data breach notification requirements if external user exports PHI without authorization.

**Prevention**:
- **BAA Verification**: Before granting external user any workspace role, verify executed BAA exists and covers Power BI / cloud services
- **Minimum Role**: Assign Contributor role (not Admin/Member) to external users to minimize privileges
- **Access Duration**: Set access termination date at time of grant (document in compliance tracking system)
- **Contractor Distinction**: External users should be easily identifiable (email domain, naming convention) for access reviews

**External User Management Workflow**:
```
External User Access Request - Workflow

Step 1: Business Justification
- Project: [Power BI Optimization]
- External Company: [Trace3]
- User: [ken.gallagher@trace3.com]
- Access Duration: [2025-10-21 to 2025-12-01]

Step 2: BAA Verification (Legal Department)
- BAA Executed:  Yes /  No
- BAA Includes Cloud Services:  Yes /  No
- If No: STOP - Cannot grant access until BAA executed

Step 3: Workspace Role Assignment (IT/BI Manager)
- Recommended Role: Contributor (default for external users)
- Escalation Required for Admin/Member:  Yes (requires CIO approval)

Step 4: Access Monitoring (Automatic)
- Weekly activity log review (security team)
- Alert on bulk export (>10,000 rows)
- Alert on off-hours access (before 8 AM or after 6 PM)

Step 5: Access Termination (Scheduled)
- Termination Date: [2025-12-01]
- Calendar Reminder: 1 week prior (2025-11-24)
- Removal: Automatic (Power Automate flow) or manual (BI Manager)

Approval Chain:
- Business Justification: [Project Manager] - APPROVED
- BAA Verification: [Legal Department] - APPROVED
- Role Assignment: [BI Manager] - APPROVED
- Final Approval: [CIO] - APPROVED (if Admin/Member requested)
```

## Healthcare Context

### HIPAA Minimum Necessary Principle
**Workspace Roles Align with Minimum Necessary**: HIPAA requires that workforce members access minimum necessary PHI to perform job functions. Workspace role assignment implements this:
- **Developers (Member)**: Need full dataset access to develop reports and measures
- **Analysts (Contributor or App User)**: Need to create reports but not edit shared datasets
- **Clinical Staff (App User)**: Need to view reports filtered to their attributed patients (RLS applied)
- **Executives (App User)**: Need aggregate views, no patient-level detail (RLS applied)

**Audit Documentation**: HIPAA audits require documentation justifying PHI access. Workspace access reviews provide this documentation, showing that access is reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on job function changes.

### Separation of Duties for Compliance
**Financial vs. Clinical Reporting**: Some healthcare organizations separate financial reporting (billing, revenue cycle) from clinical reporting (quality, patient safety) to enforce business unit independence and prevent conflicts of interest. Implement via separate workspaces:
- **Clinical Reporting Workspace**: Admins = Clinical Informatics team, Content = Quality metrics, patient census, HEDIS measures
- **Financial Reporting Workspace**: Admins = Finance IT team, Content = Revenue cycle, claims, payer contracts

**Audit Independence**: Quality audit teams may require separate workspace access from operations teams to maintain independence. For example, readmission rate auditors should not have Member/Admin roles in operational reporting workspace to prevent data tampering.

### Mobile Access and PHI Protection
**App-Based Access for Mobile**: Clinical staff accessing reports on mobile devices (field providers, on-call staff) should use app access, not direct workspace access. Apps provide:
- Simplified mobile navigation (app optimized for small screens)
- Offline caching for disconnected scenarios
- Reduced PHI exposure (curated production reports only, no workspace browsing)

**Conditional Access for Mobile**: Enforce conditional access policies for mobile app users:
- Require app protection policies (prevent screenshot, copy-paste of PHI)
- Require compliant device (MDM enrollment via Intune)
- Geo-fencing: Block access from high-risk countries
