# 06.5 - Usage Monitoring & Adoption

## Overview
Usage monitoring tracks how Power BI reports are accessed and used, providing insights into adoption patterns, identifying underutilized reports, and detecting performance issues in production. For healthcare analytics teams, usage data informs resource allocation, training priorities, and helps demonstrate ROI to leadership. Combining usage monitoring with targeted adoption strategies ensures that Power BI investments deliver value to clinical and operational workflows.

## Key Principles

- **Monitor Usage Metrics Regularly**: Track report views, unique users, and access patterns using Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics app or Activity Log API to identify adoption trends and underutilized reports.

- **Measure Adoption by User Persona**: Segment usage by role (providers, care coordinators, executives, analysts) to understand which groups are successfully adopting reports and which need additional support or training.

- **Identify Performance Issues in Production**: Use usage data combined with Performance Analyzer to find reports with high view counts but poor performance, prioritizing optimization efforts where they have the most impact.

- **Drive Adoption with Targeted Training**: Use low-usage metrics to identify training needs, then deliver role-specific training sessions, documentation, and office hours to increase engagement with specific reports.

- **Demonstrate ROI to Leadership**: Report on usage trends, time-savings metrics (e.g., "eliminated 8 hours/week of manual reporting"), and user satisfaction to justify continued Power BI investment and resources.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Usage Monitoring Workflow with Premium Capacity Metrics App

For teams with **Power BI Premium**, the **Capacity Metrics app** provides detailed usage analytics:

**Installation**:
1. Install the **Power BI Premium Capacity Metrics** app from AppSource
2. Connect to your capacity (e.g., "P1" or "EM1" for Embedded)
3. Configure data refresh (hourly recommended)

**Key Reports to Monitor**:

- **Dataset Usage by Dataset**: Shows which datasets are most queried
  - Example: `Patient Census Dashboard` dataset: 1,247 queries/day
  - Action: Prioritize this dataset for performance optimization and incremental refresh

- **Report Page Views**: Shows which report pages are most viewed
  - Example: `Daily Huddle - Overview` page: 87 unique users/day (target audience: 95 providers)
  - Analysis: 92% adoption rate among providers (strong adoption)
  - Example: `Quality Metrics - CMS Stars` page: 12 unique users/month (target audience: 45 care coordinators)
  - Analysis: 27% adoption rate (needs training intervention)

- **Query Duration Distribution**: Identifies slow queries in production
  - Example: `Patient Risk Stratification` report: 75% of queries >5 seconds (SLA violation)
  - Action: Use DAX Studio to analyze slow queries and optimize measures

**Usage Monitoring Query (Activity Log API)**:

For **non-Premium** teams, use the Activity Log API with PowerShell:

```powerquery
// Power BI Activity Log query in Power Query
let
    Source = PowerBI.Dataflows(null),
    ActivityLog = Source{[workspaceId="YOUR-WORKSPACE-ID"]}[Data],
    FilteredRows = Table.SelectRows(ActivityLog,
        each [Activity] = "ViewReport" and
        Date.From([CreationTime]) >= Date.AddDays(Date.From(DateTime.LocalNow()), -30)
    ),
    GroupedByReport = Table.Group(
        FilteredRows,
        {"ReportName", "UserId"},
        {
            {"ViewCount", each Table.RowCount(_), Int64.Type},
            {"UniqueUsers", each List.Distinct([UserId]), type list}
        }
    ),
    AddedMetrics = Table.AddColumn(
        GroupedByReport,
        "UniqueUserCount",
        each List.Count([UniqueUsers]),
        Int64.Type
    )
in
    AddedMetrics
```

**Why this works**: Provides 30-day rolling view of report usage, unique user counts, and view frequency. Use this data to build a **Usage Dashboard** for leadership.

### Example 2: Adoption Strategy for Low-Usage Clinical Report

**Scenario**: The `30-Day Readmission Dashboard` has low adoption (8 users/month) despite being critical for CMS reporting.

**Investigation Workflow**:

1. **Analyze Usage Patterns**:
   - Who is using it? (2 analysts, 6 care coordinators)
   - Who should be using it? (45 care coordinators, 12 nurse managers, 3 executives)
   - When are they using it? (Only during month-end CMS reporting)

2. **Identify Barriers**:
   - User interviews reveal:
     - "I didn't know this report existed"
     - "I tried it once but it was too slow" (12-second load time)
     - "I don't understand how to filter to my patient panel"

3. **Targeted Interventions**:

   **a. Performance Optimization** (see 02.4 - Performance Analyzer Workflow):
   - Optimize slow measures: 12s ’ 2.8s load time
   - Re-test with users after optimization

   **b. Training & Communication**:
   - Email announcement to care coordinators with screenshot and use case
   - 30-minute lunch-and-learn session: "Using the Readmission Dashboard for Patient Outreach"
   - One-page Quick Start Guide (see 05.5 - Documentation Standards)
   - Office hours: Fridays 2-3pm for questions

   **c. Integration into Workflow**:
   - Add report link to weekly care coordination team meeting agenda
   - Create Outlook reminder for care coordinators: "Review Readmission Dashboard - Weekly Patient Outreach"
   - Include dashboard metrics in monthly QI reports (visibility to leadership)

4. **Measure Results**:
   - **Pre-intervention**: 8 users/month, 12s load time, 14% awareness
   - **Post-intervention (3 months)**: 42 users/month, 2.8s load time, 87% awareness
   - **ROI**: Prevented an estimated 6 avoidable readmissions in Q3 (savings: ~$180k)

**Why this works**: Addresses the three barriers to adoption: awareness, performance, and usability. Combines technical optimization with training and workflow integration.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Monitoring Usage Without Taking Action
**Description**: Collecting usage metrics but not using them to drive decisions (e.g., which reports to deprecate, where to focus training, what to optimize).

**Impact**: Usage monitoring becomes a vanity metric rather than a tool for improvement. Teams continue investing in low-value reports while high-value reports remain underutilized. Wasted development effort and missed adoption opportunities.

**Fix**: Establish a **quarterly review process** to analyze usage data and make decisions:
- Reports with <10 users/month for 3+ months ’ Candidate for deprecation (after stakeholder review)
- Reports with >100 users/month and >5s load time ’ Priority for performance optimization
- Reports with low adoption in target audience ’ Training intervention or redesign

### Pitfall 2: Not Segmenting Usage by User Persona
**Description**: Tracking total views without understanding who is using reports and whether the right people are using them.

**Impact**: High total usage might hide the fact that target users aren't adopting the report. For example, a provider-facing dashboard might have 200 views/month, but it's all analysts and executives, not the 95 providers who need it for daily workflows.

**Fix**: Segment usage metrics by **user role** using Active Directory group membership or workspace role:
- Join Activity Log data with HR system (or manually maintained role table)
- Create usage reports showing: "Unique Providers Using Dashboard" vs. "Total Provider Count"
- Calculate adoption rate by persona: `Adoption % = Unique Users in Persona / Total Persona Count`

### Pitfall 3: Measuring Views Instead of Impact
**Description**: Focusing only on view counts without understanding business outcomes (e.g., time saved, decisions improved, errors reduced).

**Impact**: Leadership questions ROI of Power BI investment because usage metrics don't translate to business value. "You have 500 views/month, so what? Did it improve patient care or reduce costs?"

**Fix**: Supplement usage metrics with **impact metrics**:
- **Time Savings**: Survey users on time saved vs. manual reporting (e.g., "Daily huddle prep reduced from 45 min to 5 min")
- **Decision Quality**: Track clinical decisions enabled by report (e.g., "Identified 12 high-risk patients for proactive outreach")
- **Error Reduction**: Compare data accuracy before/after Power BI vs. manual reports
- **Cost Avoidance**: Estimate cost of prevented readmissions, improved HEDIS scores, etc.

**Example Impact Statement**:
> "The Patient Census Dashboard has 1,247 queries/day from 87 unique providers (92% adoption). Provider survey shows an average of 30 minutes saved per day vs. manual census reports, totaling 435 hours/month saved (equivalent to 2.7 FTE). This time is reallocated to direct patient care."

### Pitfall 4: No Feedback Loop from Users to Developers
**Description**: Usage monitoring is a one-way street - developers see usage metrics but don't gather qualitative feedback on why reports are (or aren't) being used.

**Impact**: Developers optimize the wrong things or miss critical usability issues. For example, optimizing a report that users avoid because it doesn't answer their actual questions (not a performance issue, a design issue).

**Fix**: Establish a **feedback loop**:
- Embed feedback link in every report (Power BI Q&A or Microsoft Forms)
- Quarterly user surveys (5-10 questions: satisfaction, ease of use, performance perception, feature requests)
- Monthly office hours where users can ask questions and suggest improvements
- User interviews for low-adoption reports to understand barriers

## Healthcare Context

### Performance Considerations

**Usage Monitoring Performance**:
- **Premium Capacity Metrics app** refreshes hourly and uses minimal resources (no impact on production reports)
- **Activity Log API** queries can be resource-intensive if querying large date ranges (>90 days)
  - Recommendation: Query incrementally (30-day rolling window) and append to historical table
- Avoid real-time usage tracking (excessive logging overhead)

**Clinical Workflow SLA Impact**:
- Prioritize optimization for reports with **high usage + slow performance**
  - Example: Daily huddle report with 87 users/day and 8.7s load time ’ Highest impact optimization
  - Example: Ad-hoc analysis report with 3 users/month and 12s load time ’ Lowest priority

**Usage-Based Optimization Framework**:
1. **Tier 1** (Optimize First): >50 users/day, >5s load time (clinical workflow disruption)
2. **Tier 2** (Optimize Second): 10-50 users/day, >5s load time (moderate impact)
3. **Tier 3** (Optimize Later): <10 users/day, any load time (low usage justifies lower priority)

### Compliance Notes

**HIPAA Audit Trail Requirements**:
- Power BI Activity Log provides audit trail for **report access** (who viewed what, when)
- Retention: Activity Log is retained for **30 days** in standard logs
  - For HIPAA compliance, export and retain logs for **6 years** (or 7 years in some states)
  - Use Power BI Activity Log export to Azure Log Analytics or dedicated audit database

**Activity Log Includes**:
- User principal name (UPN): `provider@absolutecare.org`
- Report name: `Patient Census Dashboard`
- Activity: `ViewReport`, `ExportReport`, `EditReport`
- Timestamp: `2025-10-21T08:34:12Z`
- IP address: `192.168.1.100`

**Sensitive Data in Usage Metrics**:
- Usage metrics may indirectly reveal sensitive patterns:
  - Example: Spike in "Patient Risk Stratification" views ’ May indicate emerging health crisis
  - Apply appropriate access controls to usage dashboards (limit to analysts, leadership)
- Do not log **filter values** or **slicer selections** in usage metrics (potential PHI exposure)

**Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**:
- If using third-party tools for usage monitoring (e.g., Google Analytics embedded in reports), ensure BAA is in place
- Microsoft Purview and Power BI Activity Log are covered under Microsoft BAA

### Adoption Strategies for Clinical Workflows

**Daily Huddle Integration**:
- Monitor adoption of daily huddle reports (target: >85% of providers)
- If adoption is low, investigate workflow integration:
  - Is the report linked in huddle meeting invite?
  - Are providers trained on how to use it?
  - Does it answer the questions they need for huddle (or is it built for what developers think they need)?

**Mobile Field Provider Adoption**:
- Track mobile vs. desktop usage with `Platform` field in Activity Log
- If mobile usage is low despite field provider audience:
  - Check mobile layout quality (see 04.3 - Mobile-Responsive Design)
  - Verify mobile app distribution and authentication setup
  - Test performance on cellular networks (not just WiFi)

**Executive Scorecard Adoption**:
- Executives have high time constraints and low tolerance for complexity
- Monitor executive usage and engagement:
  - Are they viewing reports directly or relying on analyst summaries?
  - Are they using mobile app or email subscriptions?
- If low adoption, consider:
  - Email subscriptions with key metrics (no login required)
  - Simplified executive-only views (fewer visuals, more KPIs)
  - Scheduled office hours for executive questions

**Peer Comparison for Adoption**:
- Share usage metrics with department leaders:
  - "Care Coordination team: 87% adoption vs. organization average of 62%"
  - Gamification/friendly competition can drive adoption
- Celebrate high-adoption teams in town halls or newsletters
