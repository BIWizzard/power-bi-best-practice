# 05.5 - Documentation Standards

## Overview
Comprehensive documentation transforms Power BI reports from "black boxes" into maintainable, auditable business assets. In healthcare analytics, where measure calculations drive clinical and financial decisions (quality metrics, risk scores, revenue attribution), undocumented DAX formulas create organizational riskonly the original developer understands the logic, and knowledge walks out the door when that person leaves. Documentation includes measure descriptions (what it calculates, why, edge cases), data lineage (source system ’ SQL table ’ Power BI model), user guides (how to use reports), and inline DAX comments. For AbsoluteCare's team of ~5 developers with ~1 year Power BI experience, documentation enables knowledge sharing, faster onboarding, HIPAA audit compliance, and reduction of "tribal knowledge" dependency.

## Key Principles

- **Measure Descriptions Are Mandatory**: Every measure must have a description field populated with calculation logic, business rules, filters applied, and grain (patient-level, encounter-level, monthly aggregate). Descriptions appear in tooltips when users hover over fields, reducing support questions and calculation misunderstandings.
- **Inline DAX Comments for Complex Logic**: For measures with >5 lines of DAX or complex business rules (nested CALCULATE, multiple variables, time intelligence), add inline comments explaining each step. Future developers (or your future self) will thank you when debugging 6 months later.
- **Data Lineage Documentation**: Document the full path from source system to Power BI visualwhich SQL view/table feeds which Power BI table, which transformations occur in Power Query, which relationships exist in the model. This is essential for HIPAA compliance (data provenance) and troubleshooting data quality issues.
- **User Guides for Report Consumers**: Create one-page user guides for each major report explaining purpose, how to use filters/slicers, how to interpret visuals, and who to contact for support. Store in SharePoint or embed as hidden page in report. Non-technical users need this to confidently use reports without constant developer support.
- **Change Log and Version History**: Maintain a changelog documenting what changed in each version (measures added/modified, visuals updated, data model changes). This supports rollback decisions, UAT planning, and compliance audits. Use Git commit messages or manual version history document.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Measure Description Template

**Scenario**: Document the "30-Day Readmission Rate" measure used in quality dashboard, ensuring future developers and clinical users understand calculation logic.

**Poor Documentation** (common mistake):
```dax
30-Day Readmission Rate = DIVIDE([Readmissions], [Total Discharges])
```
Measure description field: *(blank)* or "Calculates readmission rate"

**Problems**:
- What counts as a readmission? Same diagnosis? Any diagnosis?
- 30 days from what date? Admission or discharge?
- Does it filter to inpatient only or include observation stays?
- What's the denominator grain? (All patients? Only discharged patients? Exclude deaths?)

**Excellent Documentation**:
```dax
30-Day Readmission Rate =
// Calculate all-cause readmission rate for inpatient discharges
// Numerator: Patients readmitted to inpatient within 30 days of discharge
// Denominator: All inpatient discharges (exclude deaths, transfers, LWBS)
// Time period: Based on discharge date, not admission date
// Source: CMS 30-Day Hospital-Wide Readmission Measure specification

VAR _Readmissions =
    CALCULATE(
        DISTINCTCOUNT(FactEncounter[PatientKey]),
        FactEncounter[Is30DayReadmission] = TRUE(),
        FactEncounter[EncounterType] = "Inpatient"
    )

VAR _Discharges =
    CALCULATE(
        DISTINCTCOUNT(FactEncounter[PatientKey]),
        FactEncounter[DischargeDisposition] IN {"Home", "SNF", "Rehab"},
        FactEncounter[EncounterType] = "Inpatient"
    )

RETURN
    DIVIDE(_Readmissions, _Discharges, 0)
```

**Measure Description Field** (appears in tooltip when hovering over measure in field list):
```
CALCULATION: All-cause inpatient readmission rate within 30 days of discharge

NUMERATOR: Distinct count of patients with [Is30DayReadmission] = TRUE flag, inpatient encounters only

DENOMINATOR: Distinct count of patients with qualifying discharge disposition (Home, SNF, Rehab) from inpatient encounters. Excludes deaths, transfers, and left without being seen (LWBS).

GRAIN: Patient-level (uses DISTINCTCOUNT to avoid double-counting patients with multiple readmissions)

TIME PERIOD: Based on discharge date, not admission date. Filters applied via slicer apply to the discharge date.

BUSINESS RULES:
- Readmission within 30 days of discharge (not 30 days from admission)
- All-cause readmissions (any diagnosis, not just index diagnosis)
- Inpatient only (excludes ED, observation, outpatient)
- Excludes planned readmissions (identified by DRG code, see [IsPlannedReadmission] flag)

DATA SOURCE:
- FactEncounter table (ABCDW.StarSchema.FactEncounter SQL view)
- [Is30DayReadmission] flag calculated in SQL view based on discharge-to-admission interval

TARGET: <15% (organizational goal), CMS national average ~14.5%

LAST UPDATED: 2025-10-21 by Ken Gallagher
SPEC REFERENCE: CMS Hospital-Wide Readmission Measure (HWR) v12.0
```

**Why this works**: Inline comments explain DAX logic for developers. Measure description field provides business context for analysts and end-users. No ambiguity about calculation logic, grain, or source data. Future developers can maintain this measure confidently without re-deriving business rules from scratch.

### Example 2: Data Lineage Documentation

**Scenario**: Document data flow from source EMR system through SQL database to Power BI model for patient demographics dimension.

**Data Lineage Document** (stored in SharePoint or Wiki):

```markdown
# Data Lineage: DimPatient (Patient Demographics)

## Source System
- **System**: Epic EMR (Electronic Medical Record)
- **Source Table**: `Epic.dbo.Patient_Master`
- **Refresh Frequency**: Real-time (transactional database)
- **Data Owner**: Clinical Informatics Team (contact: sarah.johnson@absolutecare.com)

## Bronze Layer (Raw Data Landing)
- **Database**: `ABCDW_Bronze.dbo.Patient_Raw`
- **ETL Tool**: Azure Data Factory (ADF pipeline: `Epic_Patient_Incremental`)
- **Refresh Schedule**: Every 2 hours (8 AM, 10 AM, 12 PM, 2 PM, 4 PM, 6 PM)
- **Transformation**: None (exact copy from Epic)
- **Row Count**: ~75,000 patients
- **Retention**: 90 days

## Silver Layer (Cleaned & Conformed)
- **Database**: `ABCDW_Silver.dbo.Patient_Conformed`
- **ETL Tool**: Stored procedure `usp_Silver_Patient_Transform`
- **Transformations Applied**:
  - Data type standardization (DOB ’ DATE, Phone ’ VARCHAR(10))
  - De-duplication based on MRN (Medical Record Number)
  - Address standardization (USPS format)
  - Phone number formatting (remove dashes, parentheses)
  - NULL handling (replace blank strings with NULL)
  - PII encryption (SSN encrypted at rest)
- **Row Count**: ~74,500 patients (500 duplicates removed)
- **Retention**: 7 years (HIPAA requirement)

## Gold Layer (Business-Ready Star Schema)
- **Database**: `ABCDW.StarSchema.DimPatient` (SQL view)
- **Business Rules**:
  - Filter to active patients only ([IsActive] = 1)
  - Calculate age from DOB (as of today)
  - Age group bucketing (<18, 18-34, 35-54, 55-64, 65+)
  - Insurance rank (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)
  - Assigned PCP lookup (join to DimProvider)
  - Risk stratification flag (High/Moderate/Low based on HCC score)
- **Row Count**: ~72,000 active patients
- **Refresh Schedule**: Daily at 2:00 AM

## Power BI Model
- **Table Name**: `DimPatient`
- **Import/DirectQuery**: Import mode
- **Refresh Schedule**: Daily at 3:00 AM (1 hour after SQL view refresh)
- **Power Query Transformations**:
  - Select columns: PatientKey, MRN, FirstName, LastName, DOB, Age, AgeGroup, Gender, Address, City, State, Zip, Phone, Email, PrimaryCare ProviderKey, InsurancePrimaryPayer, RiskLevel
  - Data type verification (ensure PatientKey is Whole Number, DOB is Date)
  - Remove duplicates (should be none after Silver layer de-dup, but defensive check)
- **Relationships**:
  - DimPatient[PatientKey] ’ FactEncounter[PatientKey] (1:Many)
  - DimPatient[PrimaryCareProviderKey] ’ DimProvider[ProviderKey] (Many:1)
- **Row Count in Model**: ~72,000 rows
- **Model Size**: ~8 MB (compressed)

## Data Quality Checks
- **Check 1**: Row count match between SQL view and Power BI table (within 1% tolerance)
- **Check 2**: No NULL values in PatientKey, MRN, FirstName, LastName
- **Check 3**: Age calculated correctly (compare sample patients to manual calculation)
- **Check 4**: Active patient filter applied (no inactive/deceased patients in model)

## Change History
- **2025-10-15**: Added RiskLevel column based on HCC risk score (Ken Gallagher)
- **2025-09-01**: Changed DOB data type from DateTime to Date (performance optimization)
- **2025-08-12**: Added AgeGroup bucketing for demographic reporting
- **2025-07-20**: Initial DimPatient table creation (migration from One Big Table)

## Audit & Compliance
- **HIPAA PHI Fields**: MRN, FirstName, LastName, DOB, Address, Phone, Email (encrypted in Silver layer, RLS applied in Power BI)
- **Access Controls**: Row-level security filters by PrimaryCareProviderKey (providers see only their attributed patients)
- **Audit Logging**: All SQL view queries logged in `ABCDW.Audit.QueryLog` table
- **Data Retention**: 7 years per HIPAA requirements

## Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: Patient count doesn't match EMR report
  - **Check**: Verify [IsActive] = 1 filter applied in SQL view
  - **Check**: Compare Silver layer row count to Epic source (de-duplication may remove patients)
- **Issue**: Patient demographics out of date
  - **Check**: Verify Power BI refresh completed successfully (check refresh history)
  - **Check**: Verify ADF pipeline ran (check ADF monitoring logs for last 2-hour window)
```

**Why this works**: Complete data provenance from source EMR to Power BI visual. Troubleshooting section helps developers diagnose data quality issues quickly. Change history provides audit trail. HIPAA compliance section documents PHI handling for security audits.

### Example 3: User Guide for Daily Huddle Dashboard

**Scenario**: Create one-page user guide for daily huddle census dashboard, enabling clinical staff to use report confidently without developer support.

**Daily Huddle Dashboard - User Guide** (SharePoint document or embedded as hidden page in report):

```markdown
# Daily Huddle Dashboard - User Guide

## Purpose

- **Real-time Data**: No - for real-time census, use EMR system (Epic)

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Dashboard shows "Can't load report"**
- **Solution**: Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **If persists**: Contact IT Help Desk (ext. 5555)

**Issue: Patient count seems wrong**
- **Solution**: Check date slicer - ensure set to today
- **Check**: Verify facility slicer shows "All" (not filtered to single facility)
- **If still wrong**: Report to powerbi-support@absolutecare.com with screenshot

**Issue: High-risk patient not showing in list**
- **Explanation**: Risk score calculated daily at 2 AM with previous day's data
- **Example**: Patient admitted Monday afternoon won't show as high-risk until Tuesday 8 AM huddle
- **Workaround**: Check EMR for real-time risk assessment

**Issue: Drillthrough to patient detail not working**
- **Solution**: Ensure you right-click patient name (not other columns)

*Last Updated: October 21, 2025 | Version 2.3 | Created by: Power BI Development Team*
```

**Why this works**: Non-technical users can use dashboard confidently without developer hand-holding. Troubleshooting section preemptively addresses common questions, reducing support tickets. Training resources enable self-service learning.

## Common Pitfalls

### L Pitfall 1: No Measure Descriptions (Blank Description Fields)
**Description**: Creating measures without populating the Description field, assuming the measure name is self-explanatory or that "everyone knows what this calculates."

**Impact**: Users hover over measure field list expecting clarification but see blank tooltip. Developers inheriting the report spend hours reverse-engineering DAX logic to understand business rules. When original developer leaves, tribal knowledge evaporates. In healthcare, undocumented measures used for clinical decisions (risk scores, quality metrics) create liabilitycan't audit calculation logic, can't verify compliance with CMS/HEDIS specifications.

**Prevention**:
- **Mandatory Description Policy**: Establish team policy that every measure must have description before code review approval
- **Description Template**: Use standardized template (calculation, grain, business rules, data source, last updated, spec reference)
- **Best Practice Analyzer**: Use Tabular Editor's Best Practice Analyzer to flag measures with blank descriptions
- **Code Review Checklist**: Include "measure descriptions complete" as PR approval requirement

**Best Practice Analyzer Rule** (Tabular Editor):
```csharp
// Flag measures with missing descriptions
foreach(var m in Model.AllMeasures)
{
    if(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(m.Description))
    {
        m.Annotate("MissingDescription", "Measure has no description");
    }
}
```

### L Pitfall 2: Insufficient Inline Comments in Complex DAX
**Description**: Writing complex DAX measures (10+ lines, nested CALCULATE, multiple variables, time intelligence) without inline comments explaining each step or business rule.

**Impact**: Six months later, even the original developer can't remember why specific logic was implemented. Debugging takes 2-3x longer because every line requires re-interpretation. New team members avoid modifying complex measures for fear of breaking logic, leading to copy-paste measure proliferation instead of refactoring shared logic.

**Prevention**:
- **Comment Complex Logic**: Add inline comments for any measure >5 lines or with non-obvious business rules
- **Explain "Why" Not "What"**: Comments should explain business reasoning, not restate code (Bad: "// Calculate sum", Good: "// Exclude cancelled encounters per CMS specification")
- **Section Headers**: Use comment headers to divide long measures into logical sections

**Example - Insufficient Comments**:
```dax
HEDIS Diabetes HbA1c Control =
VAR _Denominator = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(FactEncounter[PatientKey]), FactEncounter[DiagnosisCategory] = "Diabetes", FactEncounter[Age] >= 18, FactEncounter[Age] <= 75)
VAR _Numerator = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(FactLabResult[PatientKey]), FactLabResult[LabTestCode] = "HbA1c", FactLabResult[LabValue] < 8.0, FactLabResult[LabDate] >= DATE(YEAR(TODAY()), 1, 1))
RETURN DIVIDE(_Numerator, _Denominator)
```
(Hard to understand business rules, age ranges, date logic)

**Example - Excellent Comments**:
```dax
HEDIS Diabetes HbA1c Control =
// HEDIS 2024 Measure: Percentage of diabetic patients (18-75 years) with HbA1c <8.0%
// Specification: NCQA HEDIS 2024 Volume 2, CDC measure
// Target: e70% (CMS Stars 5-star threshold)

// DENOMINATOR: Diabetic patients aged 18-75 with encounter in measurement year
VAR _Denominator =
    CALCULATE(
        DISTINCTCOUNT(FactEncounter[PatientKey]),
        FactEncounter[DiagnosisCategory] = "Diabetes",  // Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes
        FactEncounter[Age] >= 18,  // HEDIS spec: Include 18+
        FactEncounter[Age] <= 75,  // HEDIS spec: Exclude 75+ (different measure applies)
        FactEncounter[EncounterDate] >= DATE(YEAR(TODAY()), 1, 1),  // Measurement year = current calendar year
        FactEncounter[EncounterDate] <= TODAY()
    )

// NUMERATOR: Patients from denominator with most recent HbA1c <8.0% in measurement year
VAR _Numerator =
    CALCULATE(
        DISTINCTCOUNT(FactLabResult[PatientKey]),
        FactLabResult[LabTestCode] = "HbA1c",  // A1c lab test (LOINC 4548-4)
        FactLabResult[LabValue] < 8.0,  // HEDIS threshold: "Good control" = <8.0%
        FactLabResult[LabDate] >= DATE(YEAR(TODAY()), 1, 1),  // Lab drawn in current calendar year
        FactLabResult[LabDate] <= TODAY(),
        FactLabResult[IsValid] = TRUE()  // Exclude cancelled/corrected lab results
    )

RETURN
    DIVIDE(_Numerator, _Denominator, BLANK())  // Return BLANK if no denominator (avoid #DIV/0)
```

### L Pitfall 3: No Data Lineage Documentation
**Description**: Building Power BI models without documenting where data comes from (source systems, SQL tables, transformations), assuming "it's obvious from the table names" or "we'll document it later."

**Impact**: When data quality issues arise ("Why is patient count 500 lower than EMR?"), developers spend hours tracing data flow from Power BI ’ SQL ’ source system. HIPAA audits require data provenance documentationwithout it, compliance fail. New developers onboarding to team have no idea where to find source data or who owns it. Knowledge transfer during team member departures is chaotic.

**Prevention**:
- **Data Dictionary**: Create centralized data dictionary (SharePoint, Wiki, or dedicated documentation database) with lineage for each table
- **Model Metadata**: Use Power BI table descriptions to document source SQL view/table and refresh schedule
- **Power Query Comments**: Add comments in Power Query M code noting data source and transformation purpose
- **Architecture Diagram**: Create visual data flow diagram (source systems ’ Bronze ’ Silver ’ Gold ’ Power BI)

**Power BI Table Description** (appears in Model view):
```
TABLE: DimPatient
SOURCE: ABCDW.StarSchema.DimPatient (SQL view)
REFRESH: Daily at 3:00 AM (Import mode)
OWNER: Clinical Informatics Team (sarah.johnson@absolutecare.com)
GRAIN: One row per active patient
ROW COUNT: ~72,000 patients
TRANSFORMATIONS: Age calculated from DOB, AgeGroup bucketing, Risk level derived from HCC score
LAST UPDATED: 2025-10-21 - Added risk stratification column
```

### L Pitfall 4: Generic or Missing Change Logs
**Description**: Deploying report updates to Production without documenting what changed ("Updated dashboard" Git commit message) or maintaining version history ("v2.3" filename with no release notes).

**Impact**: When Production deployment introduces a bug, team can't identify what changed between v2.2 and v2.3 to isolate the problem. Rollback decisions are guesses. UAT planning is vague because testers don't know what to focus on. Compliance audits require change documentationgeneric changelogs don't satisfy auditors.

**Prevention**:
- **Detailed Git Commits**: Write descriptive commit messages with business context (not just "fixed bug" but "Fixed 30-day readmission rate denominator to exclude deaths per CMS spec")
- **Release Notes Document**: Maintain CHANGELOG.md or release notes document with version history, changes, and business justification
- **Semantic Versioning**: Use version numbers that convey meaning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH: 2.3.1 = major version 2, minor feature 3, patch 1)
- **Tag Git Releases**: Tag Git commits with version numbers for easy rollback references

**Example CHANGELOG.md**:
```markdown

```

## Healthcare Context

### HIPAA Audit Trail Requirements
**Documentation as Compliance**: HIPAA requires data provenance documentation for PHI access. Power BI documentation demonstrates:
- **Data Source**: Where PHI originates (EMR system, claims database)
- **Access Controls**: Who can access (workspace roles, RLS configuration)
- **Transformation Logic**: How PHI is processed (de-identification, aggregation)
- **Audit Logging**: Where access is logged (Power BI activity logs, SQL audit tables)

**Audit Preparation**: During HIPAA compliance audits, auditors request documentation proving PHI is accessed only on "minimum necessary" basis. Measure descriptions, RLS documentation, and data lineage diagrams satisfy this requirement.

### Knowledge Transfer and Onboarding
**Reducing Tribal Knowledge**: AbsoluteCare team (~5 developers with ~1 year experience) will experience turnover. Documentation prevents "only Sarah knows how this works" scenarios. New developers onboarding can review:
- Measure descriptions to understand calculation logic
- Data lineage to understand data flow
- User guides to understand business context
- Change logs to understand evolution of reports

**Estimated Time Savings**: Proper documentation reduces new developer onboarding from 4-6 weeks to 2-3 weeks (50% reduction).

### Clinical Decision Support
**Measure Accuracy Validation**: Clinical measures (HEDIS, CMS Stars, readmission rates) drive financial incentives and care management decisions. Documentation enables clinical SMEs to validate that measures match specifications:
- Measure descriptions reference official specs (NCQA HEDIS, CMS specifications)
- Inline comments explain business rules that map to spec requirements
- Data lineage confirms source data matches spec requirements (e.g., inpatient claims, not all encounter types)

**Quality Assurance**: Before submitting quality reports to CMS or payers, clinical team reviews measure documentation to confirm accuracy. Without documentation, no way to verify calculations are correct.
